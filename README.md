### Machine learning
##Description
Here I present some of my projects carried out for the Artificial Intelligence 2 subject.
There are 2 projects on feedforward fully connected neural network, the first is a clustering problem and the second is a regret problem.
And finally there is a test project of the hyperparameters of the neural network.
#Goals:
- Implementation of neural networks.
- Identification and correction of errors such as overfitting and underfitting.
- Analysis of the influence of each hyperparameter
