# Neuronal Network
## Description
Here I present some of my projects carried out for the subject Artificial Intelligence 2. The first is a clustering project and the second is a regression project that is carried out with a fully connected feedforward neural network. And finally there is a test project of the hyperparameters of the neural network. 
### Goals:
- Implementation, training and test of neural networks.
- Identification and correction of errors such as overfitting and underfitting.
- Analysis of the influence of each hyperparameter
