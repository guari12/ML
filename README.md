# Neuronal Network
## Description
Here I present some of my projects carried out for the Artificial Intelligence 2 subject. A clustering project and a regression project that were carried out with a fully connected feedforward neural network. And finally a test project of the hyperparameters of the neural network.
### Goals:
- Implementation, training and test of neural networks.
- Identification and correction of errors such as overfitting and underfitting.
- Analysis of the influence of each hyperparameter
