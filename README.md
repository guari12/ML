# Machine learning
## Description
Here I present some of my projects carried out for the Artificial Intelligence 2 subject.
There are 2 projects in a fully connected feedforward neural network, the first is a clustering project and the second is a regression project.
And finally there is a test project of the hyperparameters of the neural network. 
### Goals:
- Implementation, training and test of neural networks.
- Identification and correction of errors such as overfitting and underfitting.
- Analysis of the influence of each hyperparameter
